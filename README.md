# Turing Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials on the the universal probabilistic programming language **Turing**. The `markdown` folder contains files converted to markdown from the Jupyter notebooks at the root of this repository.

Note that if you have added or updated a tutorial, you must run the `weave-examples.jl` script in order to publish the markdown version. This is so that we can build moderately sophisticated models but handle the computation on our machines rather than during a Travis build.
