    "Model Comparison refers to the task of comparing the predictions of different models that are available to us. It has useful applications. The results obtained after this comparison can be used to select the 'best' model. Alternatively, instead of selecting this 'best' model, we can use Model Averaging to obtain the weighted predictions from the models. These weights can be chosen based on the 'goodness' of each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 'goodness' of a model, we are referring to how compatible it is to the data. For example, if we have a linear and a quadratic model, we ask the question: Which model best fits the data? Note that here, we cannot use the likelihood to compare the two models. The likelihood simply increases as you increase the complexity of the model. So, we need to find a technique that compares the two models while also accounting for overfitting when using complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a simple dataset which is the 8 schools example from Section 5.5 of Gelman et al (2003). This is an attempt to analyse the effect of coaching on the SAT scores of the students. We try two models: Pooled Model and Hierarchical Model. These are explained in some more detail below.\n",
